# Ryan's Reflection

This project has been a learning journey for me. When I initially started studying this subject, I discovered that the topic was both difficult and intriguing. We had trouble at first choosing the appropriate dataset and handling different variables. There were times when we were really frustrated, particularly when the RStudio code wouldn't work or our analyses didn't go as expected.

Despite these difficulties, we took time to discuss and come out with solutions. Learning new RStudio skills, doing hypothesis tests, and interpreting the results were all quite enjoyable. No matter how little we accomplished, every step forward seemed like great achievement 

Working with my teammates added another layer of learning. Even though I only join them just within a few days, they are willing to help understand the topic better. Everyone brought unique strengths to the group, and we gradually figured out how to combine these strengths to overcome obstacles. This experience taught me not only about data analysis but also about the importance of teamwork and perseverance.

All in all, this project was an amazing learning experience, even with its challenges. We gained important knowledge about the elements influencing student performance and developed our ability to execute methodical data analysis. More importantly, we grew as a team and learned how to handle the challenges of teamwork. This project sparked my interest in data analysis. I can't wait to see what it has to offer.
